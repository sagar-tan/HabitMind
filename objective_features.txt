## 5. TESTING PIPELINE (KOTLIN + COMPOSE)

* One real phone minimum

Test:

* Cold start
* App kill and relaunch
* Phone reboot
* Permission denial
* Low storage scenario

---

### 5.2 UI Testing

* Compose UI tests for:

  * Navigation
  * Habit completion
  * Task rollover

Do NOT aim for 100 percent coverage.

---

### 5.3 Manual UX Testing

This matters more.

* Can you add a habit in under 10 seconds?
* Can you log a day without friction?
* Does anything feel annoying after 5 days?

If yes, fix it.

---

## 6. BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

### Debug Build

* Run directly from Android Studio
* Logcat for crashes

---

## 7. DELIVERABLES SUMMARY

When v1 is DONE, you have:

* HabitMind app running on your phone
* Stable local data
* Clean Compose UI
* Release ready AAB
* Clear scope for v2

---

## 8. HARD TRUTH (IMPORTANT)

Jetpack Compose gives you power, but:

* Over animating will kill UX
* Over engineering will delay shipping
* You must use this daily yourself

If HabitMind does not survive **your own ADHD**, it failed.
