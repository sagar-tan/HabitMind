I am going to do four things clearly:

1. Define global UI rules
2. Define navigation and app structure
3. Walk through the **full user journey screen by screen**
4. Specify **each screen’s components, states, and interactions**

No design guessing. Everything explicit.

# PREMIUM UI + MOTION SPEC

Mobile App UI

Goal, calm, expensive, fluid, not flashy.

---

## 1. What “Premium” Actually Means Here

Premium is:

* Predictable motion
* Soft easing
* Fewer animations, done better
* Depth through spacing, not colors
* Motion that explains state change

Premium is NOT:

* Bouncy transitions
* Random fades
* Over animated charts
* Fancy gradients everywhere

---

## 2. Global Motion Rules

### Motion Timing

* Micro interactions, 120 to 180 ms
* Screen transitions, 250 to 350 ms
* Heavy transitions, max 400 ms

Nothing slower. Slowness feels laggy, not premium.

---

### Easing

Use only two easing curves across the app:

* Ease out for entering elements
* Ease in for exiting elements

Never mix random easings.

---

## 3. Screen Transitions

### Tab Switch

* Content slides horizontally
* Old screen moves out at 70 percent opacity
* New screen fades in slightly while sliding

No full fade out. That feels cheap.

---

### Push Navigation

* New screen slides from bottom
* Background scales down to 96 percent
* Subtle blur on background

This gives depth without drama.

---

### Modal Sheets

* Bottom sheet with spring free motion
* Stops cleanly, no bounce
* Drag to dismiss with resistance

---

## 4. Component Motion

### Buttons

* Scale down to 96 percent on press
* Color darkens slightly
* Release snaps back fast

No ripple effects.

---

### Cards

* Elevation increases on tap
* Shadow softens
* Content remains still

---

### Toggles and Checkboxes

* Morph animation, not switch
* State change visible before animation ends

---

## 5. Progress and Feedback

### Habit Completion

* Progress fills smoothly
* Checkmark draws itself
* Streak number increments after completion

Order matters here.

---

### Task Percentage Slider

* Thumb follows finger exactly
* Progress bar trails by 40 ms
* Percentage text updates live

This feels responsive and expensive.

---

## 6. Lists and Feeds

### Entry Appearance

* New items slide in from bottom
* Slight opacity fade
* Old items shift smoothly, no jump

---

### Deleting Items

* Swipe gesture
* Item shrinks vertically
* Space collapses smoothly

Never hard remove.

---

## 7. Charts and Analytics Motion

### Initial Load

* Axes fade in first
* Data lines draw left to right
* Numbers count up quickly

### Interaction

* Tap highlights data point
* Tooltip fades and scales in

No bouncing graphs.

---

## 8. Image and Media Transitions

### Habit Photos

* Tap opens full screen
* Image scales up from thumbnail
* Background darkens gradually

### Exit

* Image scales back into place
* Background clears first, image second

This creates continuity.

---

## 9. Typography Motion

* Headers fade in slightly delayed
* Body text appears instantly
* Numbers animate, text does not

Animating text looks amateur.

---

## 10. Loading States

### Skeletons

* Soft shimmer
* Low contrast
* No movement faster than 1.5 seconds loop

### Spinners

Avoid wherever possible.

---

## 11. Haptics

If supported:

* Light tap on completion
* Medium tap on weekly review submit
* No haptics on navigation

Haptics are seasoning, not the dish.

---

## 12. ADHD Friendly Focus Transitions

### Focus Mode

* Background dims
* Non relevant UI fades
* Active element slightly enlarges

Example, editing a task.

---

## 13. Color and Depth

* One accent color only
* Depth via shadows and scale
* Gradients only in charts

Flat does not mean lifeless.

---

## 14. Figma Specific Instructions

Tell the designer:

* Use Smart Animate only
* Define motion tokens
* Reuse transitions everywhere
* No one off animations

Create:

* Motion component library
* Transition prototypes for every navigation type

---

## Hard Truth You Need to Hear

If you:

* Add too many animations, it will feel like shit
* Copy iOS motion blindly on Android, it will feel off
* Animate everything, user will hate it in a week

Premium apps are **boring on first glance**, addictive in daily use.

---

If you want next, I can:

* Define **exact motion tokens** for Figma
* Design **one killer Home screen interaction flow**
* Or help you **cut animations that should NOT exist**

Say which one.
